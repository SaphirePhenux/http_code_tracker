# http_code_tracker
Just a really bare bones, quick and dirty awk script to track the number of times I see 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, and 5XX codes in an web / apache access_log of each code group per minute.

# TO DO SECTION :
- CREATE AN OS DETECTION SECTION TO AUTO FIND THE LOG LOCATION(S)
- CREATE A WEB SERVER / SERVICES SECTION TO DETECT WHICH WEB SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY IN USE AND THEREFORE WHICH LOGS TO LOOK FOR.
- ADD XXX CODE PURPOSE TO OUTPUT
- FEATURE / FUNCTION TO AUTO ROLL MY COLLECTION FILE AFTER IT IS 20 MB OR AFTER X AMOUNT OF HOURS / MINUTES
